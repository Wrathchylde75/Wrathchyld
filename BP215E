                        Workers must report the number of hours worked and earnings before any deductions, such as taxes, are taken
                        out. Report for the week you performed the work, NOT when the earnings were paid. Earnings include wages,
                        tips and commissions. If you are self-employed, you must report gross income for the claim week in which you
                        received the income, even if you performed the services in a prior week. Cross out and initial any corrections.
                        Sign the form. Follow all instructions to avoid delays in payments.
